description: I use serveral computers for programming which is a Mac Book Pro or a Windows machine or a Chromebook. In such a multiple environment it is very useful using Cloud IDE, so I have been using Nitrous.IO. On OSX I have to use Nitrous Desktop, because otherwise I could not type any Japanese characters. It would not be helpful if I run an IDE from Chrome App Launcher or visit directly on my Dashboard with Chrome Browser.If Secure Shell Chorme App were enable to type Japanese characters it woulde be Chromebook as perfect develop environment combined with Nitrous.IO.

I use serveral computers for programming which is a Mac Book Pro or a Windows machine or a Chromebook. In such a multiple environment it is very useful using Cloud IDE, so I have been using Nitrous.IO.

On OSX I have to use [Nitrous Desktop](https://www.nitrous.io/desktop#mac), because otherwise I could not type any Japanese characters. It would not be helpful if I run an IDE from Chrome App Launcher or visit directly on my Dashboard with Chrome Browser.

If Secure Shell Chorme App were enable to type Japanese characters it woulde be Chromebook as perfect develop environment combined with Nitrous.IO.
