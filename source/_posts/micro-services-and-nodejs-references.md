I still don't get it what is Micro-Services, I collected some references for studying from [Nodeconf.eu 2014](http://nodeconf.eu/#features). It seemes that there was a Microservices Track according to [this post](http://dejanglozic.com/2014/09/16/nodeconf-eu-2014-trip-report-part-1/).

Clifton Cunningham is CTO of [TES Global](http://www.tesglobal.com/executive-board). He was previously the CTO of the [MailOnline](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html). I read how they brought Node.js into the publication [here.](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/how-node-js-has-revolutionized-the-mailonline/) His team create a npm module called [Compoxure](https://github.com/tes/compoxure) whichenables composition of Micro-Services.

### Fred George: Outspace

I coudn't find his slides from google at Nodeconf.eu 2014. His [MicroService Architecture](http://www.slideshare.net/fredgeorge/micro-service-architecure) influences many people and he still wites codes amazingly.

### Node-RED and Bluemix

[Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) is created by IBM's Emerging Technology team which provides a development environment of IoT projects in a web browser. Node-RED uses MQTT as a messageing protocol. You can install Node-RED to [Raspberry Pi](http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/raspberrypi.html),  [BeagleBone Black](http://nodered.org/docs/hardware/beagleboneblack.html) or [SparkCore](https://github.com/krvarma/SparkCore_Node-RED).

[Bluemix](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/) provides [Node-RED Boilerplates](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/Node-RED/index.html#nodered). Blumix Bilerplates help to create an Node.js app in a few minutes.

### FeedHenry

RedHat acquired [FeedHenry](http://www.feedhenry.com/) and set in the position of Micro-Services in their portfolio.
