description: While waiting for the DHL man to deliver my Spark Core, I picked an Intel Edison up in my hand yesterday and become more interested in. It's an another tiny computer. This month I saw three Chinese state of the art products. One is a Spark Core, another is an Intel Edison, and the other is new RoboCop. When I realized it, many innovations coming from China these days. Finally my Spark Core arrived, it takes almost a month. Due to an error the order it returned to GlobalShopex. Thanks to they shipped with priority service as a compensation, it delivered in five days. I can't wait for the weekend tinkering with Spark Core and Arduino!
