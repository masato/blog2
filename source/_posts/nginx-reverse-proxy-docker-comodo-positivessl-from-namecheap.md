description: It is sufficient to use a Self-Signed SSL Certificate in my develop environment on IDCF Cloud. When it comes to the prodoction environment on Vultr, it should be better to purchase a CA-Signed SSL Certificate. Of course cheaper is better for my personal use, I choice a Cheap Comodo PositiveSSL Certificate from Namecheap. I already bought a domain name from Namecheap, it is a convenient way using same registered my account. And what is better my confidential information it protected with WhoisGuard.

It is sufficient to use a Self-Signed SSL Certificate in my develop environment on IDCF Cloud. When it comes to the prodoction environment on Vultr, it should be better to purchase a CA-Signed SSL Certificate. Of course cheaper is better for my personal use, I choice a Cheap [Comodo PositiveSSL Certificate](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx) from Namecheap. I already bought a domain name from Namecheap, it is a convenient way using same registered my account. And what is better my confidential information it protected with [WhoisGuard](https://www.namecheap.com/security/whoisguard.aspx).

### The next refactoring 

Now that my MoinMoin container is replaced with a CA-Signed SSL Certificate, the next refactoring is to separate roles of containers because my MoinMoin container has a taste of monolithic. It's a better micro service way. One is for a reverse proxy and the other is for a uWSGI server.
