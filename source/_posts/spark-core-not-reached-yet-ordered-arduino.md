Two weekes have already passed since I ordered a Spark Core to Maker Shed. It has not  delivered yet. Because I cannot wait I sent the another order for [Getting Started Kit with Arduino](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0025Y6C5G/) to Amzaon.

The Spark Core uses Arduino programming language so it will be good for me to learn Arduino beforehand.

As a companion to stduy I also ordered [Getting Started with Arduino, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/487311537X/). I can't wait until I get the package!
