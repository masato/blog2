description: When I shopped on MakerShed from Japan the shipping process was passed to GlobalShopex for international order fulfillment. After two weeks ago my order has not delivered yet. I emailed for remind and my order status finally updated. It seems that it takes a few days to receive my order. I have learned my lesson. It's better to be early reminder email for international shopping.
