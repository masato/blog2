This week ASUS Zenfone teaser site opened in Japan. It seemes that the picture is a Zenfone 6 as I overlay my Zenfone 6. I am also interested in Nexus 6, Zenfone 6 has a high cost performance at under half price.

My impression on Zenfone 6 after 2 months is mostly good. I am not so concern with tech specs that happy with middle range.

The 6 inch size display has both good and bad aspects. It is good for reading books, but not suitable for one-handed use at a packed commuter train in Tokyo.

Zenfone 6 comes with one-hand mode trying address this issue, although it remains somewhat difficult handling this size of devices.
